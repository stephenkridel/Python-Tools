# Python-Tools

Here is a repo for tools I am building to do largely simple calculations for mechanical engineering design.

The first file is a python script "StressTransformationAnalyzer.py" that takes in three vaules: SigmaX, SigmaY, & Tau and outputs a graph of the stress transformation from 0 to 360 degrees as well as prints out the principal stresses.
